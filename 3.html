    <p>Small businesses looking to create a blog are in for a treat. A blog provides a platform to showcase both your knowledge and your brand, so it’s an essential asset to your marketing strategy. That said, starting a blog from scratch with no experience can be intimidating, especially when it comes to knowing what to do before you hit ‘Publish’. 
    </p>
    <h3><u>Why start a blog?</u></h3>
    <p>Starting a blog for your small business has three main benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blogging helps establish you as an expert in your industry. Even if your business is within a niche market, you’ll undoubtedly have some competition that offers a similar product or service. Sure, there are ways to differentiate yourself in terms of marketing, but showing that your brand is knowledgeable says a lot to potential clients. Within your posts, you also have the opportunity to show off your personality, further differentiating your business from competition. If you're unsure where your blog might fit in, read up on blog niche ideas and popular types of blogs to find some inspiration. </li>
    <li>A blog creates a path from your brand to your audience, allowing you to cultivate and connect with your community. Whether it’s first-time, long-time, or potential customers, having a place to join in on the conversation with a business helps build trust and encourages repeat buyers</li>
<li>A blog is a great way to earn revenue. In fact, you can make money blogging as a full-time job, or as a way to earn extra cash on the side.</li>
